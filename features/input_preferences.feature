Feature: Input Group Preferences
  As a TA
  In order to set up the project-group match
  I want to input group preferences
  
  # Scenario: Add a new group with preferences
  #   Given I am on the groups page
  #   Then the Add Group button should exist
  #   And I click the Add Group button
  #   Then I should be on the Add Group form
  #   And I input the group information
  #   And I set the group preferences # This line probably needs to be expanded?
  #   And I press submit
  #   Then the new group should exist with my preferences set
